iGoSyncDocs 2011

If you're a Google Docs user who sometimes needs to work out of range of Internet connection, then you may want to find an alternative -- at least, for a while.

Google Gears has never been an ideal solution. I've used it on two platforms -- notebooks using Windows XP, and Linux-based notebooks -- and in both cases, I experienced problems with browser incompatibility, occasional Gears shut-downs, and once or twice, the loss of a couple of hours of work when an offline version didn't sync properly.

Right now, of course, there's another way to do it. That's why this project was started up. The idea is very clear that someone or something should let us access any files locally from any desktop, edit Google Docs files offline, easily and quickly import all files into Google Docs and sync between multiple computers(PCs, Macs and Linux).
